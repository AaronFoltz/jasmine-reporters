# Jasmine Reporters

Jasmine Reporters is a collection of javascript jasmine.Reporter classes that can be used with
the [jasmine testing framework](http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/).

Right now the project is focused on two new reporters:</p>

* ConsoleReporter - Report test results to the browser console.
* JUnitXmlReporter - Report test results to a file (using Rhino) in JUnit XML Report format.
